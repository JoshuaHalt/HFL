To start a new season:
1. Change HFL.Yahoo.LeaguePage to the new site location in HFL.config
2. Change the default year in HFL.html and Add.html (the line number is stated at the top of the files)
3. Go to the XML folder and copy last year's file, rename it to the new year
4. Update the team data with the new names, any new players, and yahoo IDs
5. Delete weeks 2-16, set all week 1 scores to 0, not blank! If there are new teams, add their names too.
6. Upload HFL.config, Web.config, HFL.html, Add.html, and the XML file (in the xml folder)
7. Easy enough, right?
