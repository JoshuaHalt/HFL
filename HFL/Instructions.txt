New season process:
1. Change <yahooURL> to the new site location in xml\Settings.xml
2. Change <year> to the new year in xml\Settings.xml
3. Copy last year's XML file, rename it to the new year
4. Update the team data with the new names, any new players, and yahoo IDs
5. Delete weeks 2-16, set all week 1 scores to 0, not blank! If there are new teams, add their names too.
6. Upload Settings.xml and the new year's XML file (both in the xml folder)
7. Before doing step 1, go to AddSeason.html, which is way easier than the steps here.
